## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Josh Comeau reset
- SASS preprocessor
- JavaScript

### What I learned

Making an hamburger menu that becomes part of the nav bar when the page is enough large was a challenge. I wrote a lot of lines just to align everything properly.
I think the best solution here would be to stop writing all the code by hand, so i'm thinking of trying to learn a framework to make these long work easier to tweak

### Continued development

I will be working on a framework to make it easier to create complex components that took me a lot of time writing, like a responsive dropdown menu that collapses on mobile view

### Useful resources

- [Pixel perfect](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/perfectpixel-by-welldonec/dkaagdgjmgdmbnecmcefdhjekcoceebi) - I wanted to get as precise as possible with this design, so this extension helped me compare my solution to the design right on the page
